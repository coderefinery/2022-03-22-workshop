    <h2 id="how-to-join">How to join</h2>
<p>We are normally limited by number of expert helpers and individual
exercise leaders, so we use a livestream to reach more people.  Anyone
may watch the livestream (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/coderefinery">https://twitch.tv/coderefinery</a>), and we
have Zoom for breakout sessions up to our capacity.  Some partners may
even host in-person breakout rooms.  Read more about <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/">how to attend a
livestream
course</a>.</p>
<h3 id="attend-via-livestream-only">Attend via livestream only</h3>
<p>The promise of the Internet is that we can reach everyone, so why
don't we?  We teach on a Twitch livestream
(<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/coderefinery">twitch.tv/coderefinery</a>) so that
anyone may attend the workshop.  With livestream attendance, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All workshop content, text and video.</li>
<li>Videos released the same day.</li>
<li>Ability to ask questions, if you register.</li>
<li>Ability to do exercises yourself, or in a self-organized group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees report a great experience with these livestream courses!
<strong>We recommend that you form your own team and do exercises together
in your own breakout room (in-person or online)</strong>.  We will support
this as much as we can!  You <em>will</em> be able to ask us questions if you
register.</p>
<p><strong>Please register anyway so that you can get emails and we can better
report our impact</strong> (but you don't have to).</p>
<h3 id="attend-via-livestream-zoom">Attend via livestream + Zoom</h3>
<p>To provide interactive support, we also host parallel a Zoom session.
Learners watch the livestream during teaching, and work in Zoom during
exercises.</p>
<p>In Zoom, we group attendees into teams with an exercise leaders and
help from our staff.  This makes a very interactive workshop, but
unfortunately we have limited resources to accept these
registrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Register as type <code>Zoom Learner</code> or <code>Zoom Exercise leader</code></li>
<li>You may register as a <strong>solo learner</strong>, we'll try to take as many as
we can (up to the number of exercise leaders who volunteer)</li>
<li>If a <strong>team</strong> registers with their own exercise leader, you get
priority and we will try to accept the whole team.  Everyone on the
team should register separately and set the same <code>Team name</code> in the
registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attending via Zoom will give you everything the livestream does, with
the possibly of centrally organized teams and a bit more help.</p>
<h3 id="faq-how-should-i-register">FAQ: how should I register?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I am alone and want to work with others, how should I register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Register for Zoom (if we are full you get the livestream anyway)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why teams?</strong>
<ul>
<li>People learn best in small groups, even if the primary teaching
sessions can reach many people and be effective.  Our strategy
gives us the best of both worlds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I am making my own team, how should I register?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Want more personal support:</strong> <code>Zoom</code> you will have more
support from our expert helpers, which may be good for less
confident teams.</li>
<li><strong>Want to manage everything yourself</strong> (for example make your own
Zoom or in-person room): <code>Livestream only</code>.  The coordinator can
still join our CodeRefinery chat and interact with us.</li>
<li>The coordinator could register on behalf of your team and forward
information to the others (but it's nice if everyone registers, see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>My complete team will work together in a physical room, is there
any point to joining your Zoom?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expert helpers will drop by the Zoom breakout room and ask if
things are going OK.  If you won't want to screenshare with them
and see their demos, there is probably no point.  (Note that Zoom
is still useful in the physical room for screensharing with each
other).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I want to make my team on my own, do I need to register?  Does
everyone on the team need to register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Technically you don't have to, if you carefully check the website
for news.</li>
<li>We prefer if you register so that we can report our impact better.
Also, the team gets emails direct from us and the HackMD links to
ask questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I'm an organization or group, I want to sponsor my community's teams!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Great!  You can do this with or without communicating with us.
Feel free to just make your own registration form and manage it if
you want.  Or talk with us organize them as part of our centrally organized Zoom.

rooms</a>

</ul>
<h3 id="price-and-zoom-priority-policy">Price and Zoom priority policy</h3>
<p>The course is free of charge, funded by the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neic.no/">Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>When we have more sign-ups as <strong>individual learners</strong> than our capacity allows, the following priority criteria apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Partner communities</li>
<li>National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries and Estonia</li>
<li>Private companies and government agencies in Nordic countries or Estonia</li>
<li>European national universities or research institutes from outside the Nordics.</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore it is very important that you use an email address
corresponding to your affiliation.  If you aren't accepted to the Zoom
session, you can always attend the stream part.</p>
<p>If you come as a <strong>complete team</strong> (i.e. including at least one
exercise leader that can attend all the days), we will accept you up
to the technical capacity of our meeting.  Same for <strong>exercise
leader</strong> and other learners they bring with them (to combine with
others).</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakout rooms with exercise leaders gives a community atmosphere
and private help.</li>
<li>Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
by demo.</li>
<li>We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
pace later on.  Videos don't include audience voice or video.</li>
<li>HackMD allows anyone to ask questions anonymously and
asynchronously, without interrupting others.  On the other hand,
there are a <em>lot</em> of questions, so don't let it distract you from
the main lecture.</li>
<li>Lesson websites/HackMD use standard web technologies, so that
browser accessibility plugins can be used (for example making the
font more accessible, check browser extensions).</li>
<li>Twitch can be live-captioned using the Google Chrome browser.</li>
<li>You can follow along without providing any personal data
(registration, Twitch works with cookies blocked).</li>
<li>We have figures in some lessons which are somewhat important,
without good alt text.  We are working on this, contributions
welcome.</li>
