  title: 1.2 Git Intro
  description: >
    Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, though
    this is not the most basic course you can find.  We cover basics,
    motivation, making commits, undoing things, staging.  The part 2
    video goes into branching and merging, conflict resolution,
    inspecting history, basics of sharing repositories online, and
    some practical advice.  However, this does not cover multi-user
    work or remotes (that is the next lesson, git-collaborative).

    There are two external videos which are excluded from this
    recording.  You can find the link to them in the table of contents

  title: 4.1 Reproducible Research
  description: >
    If you can't get your code to do the same thing again, is it
    really science?  Or more practically, are you able to do your
    work?  Reproducibilty is a big deal, but we don't always learn how
    to do it.  In this lesson, we cover the basics, how to organize
    projects, record computational steps with Snakemake or other
    workflow managers, how to record environments with conda (and docker
    a bit), and sharing code and data (FAIR).

  title: 4.2 Social coding
  description: >
    We don't just program for ourselves: we are part of a community.
    As scientists, we want to get citations, so how can our software
    support this?  Our work is a constant balance between using the
    work of others and hoping that others will use our work.  In this
    lesson, we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of others
    building on our work, and how to support that.

    We cover best practices for software/data projects, requirements
    for sharing, copyright, licensing, citation, and more.

    This lesson teachs learners the user interface of JupyterLab, how
    Jupyter notebooks work, and what some common and powerful usecases
    are. Our focus is to demonstrate and discuss and guide towards
    good practices for reproducibility, collaboration, and
    reusability. The emphasis of this lesson is to demonstrate how to
    use notebooks in combination with version control and how to share
    reproducible notebooks via Binder.

    This lesson demonstrates the use of JupyterLab, nbdime,
    jupyterlab-git, and Binder.

  description: >
    In this lesson we discuss different solutions for implementing and
    deploying code documentation. We start by creating a wishlist for
    how we would code documentation like to be. Then after a tour of
    available tools, we discuss how to write useful and accessible
    READMEs, and then we progress by demonstrating and practicing the
    Sphinx documentation generator and demonstrate how to deploy
    documentation to Read the Docs service.

    Topics and tools discussed: Markdown, reStructured text, README
    documentation, table of contents generation, Sphinx, Read the
    Docs, GitHub/GitLab pages.

#
#    Tools covered include concepts of testing for science, unit testing, pytest, continuous integration, GitHub actions .  We make demos in Python, but have examples in other languages and this will apply to every language in some form.

#  description: >
#    In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as starting point which reads data, computes simple statistics, and generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.
#
#    In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas,
#    Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration
#    of pair programming.
