  title: 1.2 Git Intro
  description: >
    Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, though
    this is not the most basic course you can find.  We cover basics,
    motivation, making commits, undoing things, staging.  The part 2
    video goes into branching and merging, conflict resolution,
    inspecting history, basics of sharing repositories online, and
    some practical advice.  However, this does not cover multi-user
    work or remotes (that is the next lesson, git-collaborative).

    There are two external videos which are excluded from this
    recording.  You can find the link to them in the table of contents
    below.

    Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, though
    this is not the most basic course you can find.  Previous video:
    We covered basics, motivation, making commits, undoing things,
    staging.  This part 2 video goes into remotes and basics of

    recovering, and some practical advice.  However, this does not
    cover multi-user work or remotes (that is the next lesson,

#    If you can't get your code to do the same thing again, is it
#    really science?  Or more practically, are you able to do your
#    work?  Reproducibilty is a big deal, but we don't always learn how
#    to do it.  In this lesson, we cover the basics, how to organize
#    projects, record computational steps with Snakemake or other
#    workflow managers, how to record environments with conda (and docker
#    a bit), and sharing code and data (FAIR).

#  description: >
#    We don't just program for ourselves: we are part of a community.  As scientists, we want to get citations, so how can our software support this?  Our work is a constant balance between using the work of others and hoping that others will use our work.  In this lesson, we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of others building on our work, and how to support that.
#
#    We cover best practices for software/data projects, requirements for sharing, copyright, licensing, citation, and more.

#    The goal of this lesson is to teach learners the user interface of JupyterLab, how Jupyter notebooks work, and what some common and powerful usecases are. Our focus is to demonstrate and discuss and guide towards good practices for reproducibility, collaboration, and reusability. The emphasis of this lesson is to demonstrate how to use notebooks in combination with version control and how to share reproducible notebooks via Binder.
#
#    This lesson demonstrates the use of JupyterLab, nbdime, jupyterlab-git, and Binder.

#  description: >
#    In this lesson we discuss different solutions for implementing and deploying code documentation. We start by creating a wishlist for how we would code documentation like to be. Then after a tour of available tools, we discuss how to write useful and accessible READMEs, and then we progress by demonstrating and practicing the Sphinx documentation generator and demonstrate how to deploy documentation to Read the Docs service.
#
#    Topics and tools discussed: Markdown, reStructured text, README documentation, table of contents generation, Sphinx, Read the Docs, GitHub/GitLab pages.

#    Software testing is a fundamental part of modern software development, and especially important for science since results should be correct.  Luckily, it's not so hard to get started, and anyone can do it. This is a crash course for scientists to get started testing their software.
#
#    Tools covered include concepts of testing for science, unit testing, pytest, continuous integration, GitHub actions .  We make demos in Python, but have examples in other languages and this will apply to every language in some form.

#  title: Modular Code Development - CodeRefinery May 2021
#  description: >
#    In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as starting point which reads data, computes simple statistics, and generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.
#
#    In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas,
#    Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration
#    of pair programming.
